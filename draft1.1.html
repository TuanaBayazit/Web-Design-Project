                        Hi, I'm Tuana.        
                    </p>
                    <p>In this section, I will talk briefly about my educational background. 
                        In 2019, I was accepted to the Computer Education and Instructional Technologies department at the Middle East Technical University and started the preparatory program.
                        I have currently completed my 7th semester of undergraduate studies and will graduate from my major at the end of my 8th semester.
                        As you can see in the table below, I am registered for a minor program. 
                        I applied for a minor at the end of my freshman year and was accepted. 
                        I will complete my minor program one semester after finishing my major, in February 2026.</p>
                        <p>At the bottom of the table there is a section where I talk about what I like to do, you can read that section if you want to learn more about me.</p>

            <h3>What do I enjoy doing?</h3>
            <p>I believe there is a lot to learn in life and I love discovering new things while doing things I enjoy.
                I am happy to drive for hours and have fun and pleasant conversations during driving. 
                I also like to discover new places with my friends and collect memories for both the future and the past. 
                Even though I don't like going out very much in the winter months, I love spending time outside and walking when it snows.
                Contrary to winter, I like to spend time outside in the summer.
                In the summer months, I enjoy fishing with my father and sewing with my mother to try new things. 
                Other activity I really enjoy is lying on the grass at DEVRIM and reading a book for hours.
                Wanting to immortalize that moment at any given moment on campus is enough for me to take a photo at that moment. 
                Here are some photos in my perspective..</p>

                    <p>When I was given German as an elective in high school, I realized that I enjoyed learning a language.
                        Studying at English medium university gives us to learn a new language, but I also want to learn another language in addition to English. 
                        Then, I had a goal of learning a language in addition to English before I graduate university. 
                        German is a language that requires effort and time, and since I don't have much time, I progress more slowly, while I can learn Swedish a little faster. 
                        Watching German series with English-German double subtitles also helps me learn the language.
                         Also, when I watch Swedish series, I have the opportunity to learn new things about pronunciation and the culture of the language.</p>

Although it was a new formation, it was a community with a good mission. I volunteered in our first event, "Behavioral Science", and had a good experience. <img src="09d662c1-81f3-4c85-b78d-fe402d765b08.jpg" alt="about-enjoy" class="exp-img"> </div>

I took part in the "telemetry" group in this community, which consists of certain sub-working groups for electric vehicle production. 
                        In December 2023, I took on the role of Electronics Coordinator with my other two friends and continued this role until June 2024. <img src="Ekran Resmi 2025-01-17 01.03.07.png" alt="tek-img" class="exp-img"></div>

In addition to helping pack books and other supplies that children need during the term, I went there in the summer of 2024 and spent time scanning the letters written by the children, reading the children's exams and transferring this data to an Excel file, and sometimes writing responses to the children's letters.
                         I hope that one day I will have the opportunity to participate in one of the valuable projects.

                    <div class="experience-title">Sustainable Project Management Intern</div>
                    <div class="experience-description">
                        My first online internship was at 100sCLub on sustainable project management. 
                        The fact that March 8 Women's Day was recently gave us the opportunity to design a project that focused on women at the center of this internship. 
                        There was no training process during the internship and we were only asked to design an artificial intelligence-integrated project and present it as a group. 
                        <br>Only the planning phase would be prepared and such a project would be considered as done. Approximately 3 weeks were given for this preparation process. 
                        The specific problems I experienced in the group I randomly joined allowed me to improve my tolerance level and emotional state control.
                        Even though we went through a difficult process, we completed the internship in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tuana-bayazƒ±t-_merhaba-gen√ß-yetenek-seninle-harika-bir-activity-7189954864225861632-q6E2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">winner</a> place.

                    <div class="experience-description">This internship I completed online was about project management. 
                        The training process lasted 4 weeks and there were 4 inventories that we had to complete afterwards. 
                        There were different trainings every week during the training process and these included the titles "Fundament of Advertising and Marketing", "Fundament of Project Management and Project Management Strategies", "Fundament of New Media and Digital Transformation", "Fundament of Management and Organization". 
                        After the trainings that lasted every weekday evening were completed, the inventory files requested by each trainer were delivered to the company on the specified date.
                         In addition to learning new things in a different field, it was also sweet to be given a certificate to those who successfully completed the internship.

                    <div class="experience-title">2D Animation Effect Design</div>
                    <div class="experience-description">I designed various 2D Animation Effects in Adobe Illustrator to depict the walking modes and powers of the character in the game in a company that was in the process of being established.
                        <br> This volunteer work, which lasted about 7 months, not only gave me the opportunity to improve myself, but also helped me improve my time management and planning skills by managing my school and work schedule together.
                        <br> Having the opportunity to gain experience in the field of design also gave me the opportunity to discover whether I liked this field or not.
                        <br>I also translated all the content in the game from English to Turkish, and completed the Spanish translation with the help of ChatGPT.
